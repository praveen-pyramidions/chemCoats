            {/* An ESD (Electrostatic Discharge) anti-static floor is designed to
            control the buildup and discharge of static electricity, protecting
            sensitive electronic equipment and preventing costly damage in
            environments like electronics manufacturing, clean rooms, and
            laboratories. These floors are made from various materials, each
            offering unique benefits depending on the specific needs of the
            workspace. ESD vinyl flooring is one of the most common types, made
            from vinyl with conductive elements embedded in the material. It
            provides a smooth, non-porous surface that is durable and easy to
            maintain, making it ideal for areas where consistent conductivity is
            essential, such as assembly lines or server rooms. ESD rubber
            flooring, on the other hand, is made from rubber compounds mixed
            with conductive materials, offering excellent slip resistance,
            comfort underfoot, and durability */}
            An ESD (Electrostatic Discharge) anti-static floor is employed to
            limit static accumulation (static build-up) and electrostatics
            discharge (static discharge across working, handled, and exposed
            areas) of sensitive electronic devices, which in turn safeguards
            electronic devices and stops costly destructions in areas like
            electronics production, clean rooms, and laboratories. Floors are
            made from a series of materials, each of which has its own
            properties which give them respective advantages in respect of the
            work space’s needs. ESD vinyl flooring is one of the most common,
            i.e., with conductive elements it consists of vinyl. It provides a
            smooth, nonporous, wear-resistant, and easy-to-maintain surface,
            which is a promising option for applications where continuous
            required conductivity is needed, such as assembly lines or server
            rooms. ESD rubber flooring, however, is just rubber compounds
            impregnated with conductive fillers, and provides the best slip
            resistance, comfort, as well as durability.
          </p>
          <p>
            {/* This type of flooring is often used in environments where workers
            stand for long periods or in areas where slip resistance is crucial.
            For those seeking a seamless and highly durable solution, ESD epoxy
            flooring is a popular choice. It consists of a self-leveling epoxy
            resin that creates a smooth, long-lasting surface ideal for
            high-tech areas like clean rooms and laboratories. ESD tile
            flooring, typically made from vinyl or ceramic tiles, provides a
            modular approach to ESD protection, allowing individual tiles to be
            replaced if damaged while still maintaining an effective anti-static
            environment. Lastly, conductive carpet tiles offer an aesthetic,
            comfortable solution for offices or less industrial settings, where
            a softer walking surface is desired but static control is still
            important. */}
            Such floorings are routinely used in the situations where the
            employees are in statuesque position for prolonged periods or where
            skid resistance is also required. ESD epoxy flooring is a nice
            solution to those who want a wide and durable construction. Its
            construction is based on a self-levelling epoxy resin providing a
            hard, wear-resistant surface suitable for such cutting-edge
            technologies as clean rooms and laboratories. Electrostatic
            discharge (ESD) tile flooring (e.g., vinyl or ceramic tiles) provide
            a plug-and-play option for ESD protection in that, porous tiles,
            which can get damaged, can be simply replaced without ruining the
            anti-static field. Second, conductive carpeting tiles offers a
            visually appealing, comfortable alternative for the office or
            industrial settings in which a more cushioned surface is desired
            while static control is required.
