            standards, ensuring a controlled environment for the sensitive
            electronics and semiconductor components being manufactured.
            Understanding the critical nature of electrostatic discharge (ESD)
            in these environments, we meticulously designed and implemented a
            flooring system that would provide effective static control while
            maintaining long-term durability and performance. */}
            During the FLEX-INTEL Project, we were tasked with designing the
            Anti-Static Flooring that would top the industry with a safe
            environment for the flammable electronic and semiconductor devices
            that are supposed to be produced. Based on the knowledge that static
            discharge (ESD) is a major factor in these environments, we
            deliberately designed and delivered a flooring strategy that would
            provide good static control while being long-term robust and
            functional.

            {/* Our commitment to quality was central to the success of the project,
            and it was reinforced by a rigorous quality control process
            throughout every stage of the project. From initial planning and
            material selection to installation and final inspection, we adhered
            to strict standards to guarantee that the flooring would meet the
            specific needs of the facility. To ensure the flooring system's
            effectiveness and compliance with industry regulations, we
            incorporated third-party tests at each phase of the process,
            verifying that the product met or exceeded the required
            conductivity, durability, and safety standards for ESD-sensitive
            environments. */}
            Quality was at the core of the success of the project and
            subsequently sustained by a strong quality gate principle, which was
            applied to every single stage of the project. Conceptually from the
            outset and in terms of material selection throughout to the final
            check process, we strictly followed procedures to guarantee that the
            flooring would meet the requirements of the facility in question. To
            assure the performance and compliance of the floor system with
            industry standards, we funded third-party testing at each step of
            the procedure, to verify that the product met or exceeded the
            required conductivity, durability, and safety properties in order to
            be applied to ESD-prone environments.

            solution was not only highly effective but also reliable and

            independent testing at every stage, we were able to deliver a
            solution that ensured optimal performance, minimized the risk of
            static-related damage, and contributed to the overall efficiency and

            This one-stop-shop concept confirmed that both powerful,

            also compliant with the demanding criteria of the FLEX INTEL
            Project. By strictly adhering to the best in class quality standards
            and independent testing across the pipeline, we were able to present
            a solution able to achieve maximum performance, while reducing
            static-induced degradation risk while simultaneously supporting
            broader facility efficiency and safety.
