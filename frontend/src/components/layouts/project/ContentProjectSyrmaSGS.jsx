            {/* Syrma SGS, a prominent motherboard and electronics manufacturing
            company, required a specialized ESD (Electrostatic Discharge)
            flooring solution that could provide a highly controlled environment
            to prevent static build-up, which could potentially damage sensitive
            electronic components during production. To ensure the integrity of
            their high-tech manufacturing processes, Syrma SGS sought a flooring
            solution that would adhere precisely to the most stringent industry
            standards, including IEC 61340 and ANSI 2020 standards, which are
            internationally recognized for their effectiveness in managing
            electrostatic discharge in electronic manufacturing environments. */}
            Syrma SGS, a leading motherboard and electronics manufacturing
            company, needed an advanced static-discharge (ESD) flooring solution
            that would allow precise control of the ESD environment to avoid
            electrostatic discharge (ESD), which could lead to damage of
            electronic components under production. In order to verify the
            reliability of their advanced manufacturing processes, Syrma SGS
            purchased a flooring solution that would conform to the most
            exacting industry standards (including IEC 61340 and ANSI 2020
            standards, which are the most recognized internationally for
            mitigating electrostatic discharge in the electronic manufacturing
            environment).

          <p>
            {/* Understanding the critical nature of this requirement, our team
            worked closely with Syrma SGS to design and implement an ESD
            flooring system that met all necessary specifications for
            conductivity, durability, and safety. The flooring solution we
            provided was not only compliant with IEC 61340 (which governs the
            requirements for ESD control in sensitive electronic environments)
            but also met the latest ANSI 2020 standards, ensuring it was up to
            date with the latest industry practices. */}
            Recognizing the critical importance of this requirement, we, a team,
            partnered closely with Syrma SGS to develop and install an ,

            </a>
            and all its pertinent specifications, i.e., conductivity,
            durability, and safety. The flooring solution that we offered was
            not just in accordance with IEC 61340 (defining the principles of
            ESD control in sensitive electronic environment) but also in line
            with the new ANSI 2020 requirements, keeping it up to date with the
            recent industry standard.
          </p>
          <p>
            {/* By providing this highly controlled static current floor, we ensured
            that Syrma SGS could maintain a safe and efficient manufacturing
            process for their sensitive electronic components, eliminating the
            risk of electrostatic discharge damage. The successful
            implementation of this flooring solution demonstrated our ability to
            deliver custom, high-performance solutions that meet the most
            exacting standards in the electronics industry, ensuring compliance
            with industrial safety requirements while enhancing the overall
            operational efficiency of the facility. */}
            In doing so, we provided this extremely controlled static current
            floor and thereby allowed Syrma SGS to produce safe and effective
            manufacturing process for their delicate electronic items without
            electrostatic discharge damage. The successful deployment of this
            floor covering solution illustrated our capability to provide
            tailored, high-performance solutions which conform to the highest
            standards in the industry of electronics, ensuring industrial safety
            compliance and improving the overall facility operational
            effectiveness.
