            concern related to the risk of electrical shocks near high-voltage
            electrical panels, which posed a significant danger to passing work
            crews. To mitigate this hazard and ensure a safe working
            environment, the plant required an effective solution that would
            both prevent electrical shocks and comply with stringent safety
            standards. In response to this urgent need, we acted swiftly to
            implement a solution that would meet the highest safety standards. */}
            The Cadbury production unit plant in Sri City raised the greatest
            safety issue in terms of the risk of electrical shocks around
            high-voltage electrical panels, which represented a serious risk to
            any work crew walking past them. To avoid this risk and ensure a
            safe work environment plant required a workable solution that would
            not only eliminate electroshock sources but also comply with the
            strictest safety standards. Together with this urgent necessity, we
            acted immediately to implement a solution that would adhere to the
            most stringent safety requirements.

            concern by applying dielectric coatings specifically designed to
            provide electrical insulation and prevent contact with live
            electrical components. The coatings we applied were fully compliant
            with IS 15652 standards, ensuring that they met the required
            specifications for electrical safety in industrial environments.
            This dielectric coating not only enhanced safety by preventing
            accidental electrical contact but also contributed to maintaining
            the integrity of the plant's electrical systems. */}
            Over a brief period of time our team successfully resolved the issue
            by the use of dielectric coatings, designed to act as electrical
            insulators and to ensure the isolation from live electrical parts.
            The coatings that we deposited were in accordance with ISO 15652
            standard, in order to meet the required electrical safety
            regulations in an industrial environment. Not only did this
